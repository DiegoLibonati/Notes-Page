## Educational Purpose

This project was created primarily for **educational and learning purposes**.

The main goal is to explore and demonstrate best practices, patterns, and technologies in software development.

## Description

I made a web page that allows the user to save notes. With the notes you can add a new one, edit an existing one and delete a specific note. Every time the user performs an action an alert will pop up.
